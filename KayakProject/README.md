# Project ðŸš§

The team discovered that 70% of their users who are planning a trip would like to have more information about the destination they are going to.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to recommend where people should plan their next holidays. Based on real data about:

- Weather
- Hotels in the area

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
1. Scrape data from destinations.
2. Get weather data from each destination.
3. Get hotels' info about each destination.
4. Store all the information above in a data lake.
5. Creating Maps: Creating two maps, one showcasing the top 5 destinations and another highlighting the top 20 hotels in the area.
6. Extract, transform, and load cleaned data from your data lake to a data warehouse.

## Data Sources
- Use [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) to get the GPS coordinates of all the cities (no subscription required). Documentation: [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/)
- Use [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid) (you have to subscribe to get a free API key) and [One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to get some information about the weather for the 35 cities and put it in a DataFrame.
- Scrape Booking.com for hotel data:
  - Hotel name
  - URL to its booking.com page
  - Coordinates (latitude and longitude)
  - Score given by the website users
  - Text description of the hotel

## ETL
Once you upload your data onto S3, it will be better for the next data analysis team to extract clean data directly from a Data Warehouse. Therefore, create a SQL Database using AWS RDS, extract your data from S3, and store it in your newly created DB.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following:

- **Notebook**: This folder contains a notebook with the tasks performed during the project.
- **CSV File**: Additionally, there is a CSV file included in this repository that contains all the information collected during the project.
